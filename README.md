# Memory-Efficient Shooter Prototype

## Overview
This Unity prototype demonstrates object pooling as a memory
optimization technique compared to traditional object spawning.

## Gameplay Feature
- Object pooling for projectiles
- Reduced garbage collection overhead
- Stable memory usage during gameplay

##
- Enemy shoots ate you while you try to collect objects and avoid spikes

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Unity
2. Load the MainScene
3. Press Play

## Gameplay Logic
Projectiles are reused instead of destroyed, reducing memory
allocations and garbage collection spikes.
